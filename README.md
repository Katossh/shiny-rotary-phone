# Starforge NixOS configuration

Declarative NixOS configuration for the `starforge` workstation.

The repository manages the operating system, Niri desktop, Noctalia shell,
virtual machines, host security baseline, and user-level desktop settings.
Terminal packages and dotfiles remain integrated from
[terminal-dotfiles](https://github.com/Katossh/terminal-dotfiles).

## Repository layout

- `flake.nix`, `flake.lock`: inputs, pinned dependencies, formatter, and host output.
- `hosts/starforge/`: machine-specific configuration and generated hardware details.
- `modules/nixos/`: reusable system-level modules.
- `home/katossh/`: Home Manager configuration for the user.
- `.github/workflows/nixos.yml`: formatting, flake evaluation, and system build checks.

## Hardware profile

The host profile targets an AMD Ryzen 5 7600X and its integrated Radeon RDNA2
GPU on an AM5 platform.

- AMD CPU microcode and redistributable firmware are enabled.
- AMD P-State active mode is enabled for modern Ryzen power/performance scaling.
- The AMDGPU kernel driver is loaded in the initrd for early KMS.
- Mesa graphics acceleration and 32-bit graphics support are enabled.
- Vulkan and VA-API diagnostic tools are installed.
- `amdgpu_top`, `lm_sensors`, `nvme-cli`, `smartmontools`, `pciutils`,
  and `usbutils` provide hardware monitoring and diagnostics.
- Bluetooth, NetworkManager, UPower, and power-profiles-daemon remain enabled.
- `fwupd` is enabled for firmware updates on devices supported by LVFS.

The motherboard's Wi-Fi and Bluetooth devices still depend on the exact
wireless module fitted to the board revision. Redistributable firmware and
the in-kernel drivers are enabled; verify the detected chipset with
`lspci -nnk` and `lsusb` after installation.

## Virtualisation

The host uses AMD KVM with QEMU and libvirt:

- `kvm-amd` is retained in the generated hardware configuration.
- `virtualisation.libvirtd` provides the system VM daemon.
- QEMU guests run as the dedicated unprivileged `qemu-libvirtd` account.
- `swtpm` is enabled for virtual TPM 2.0 devices, useful for Windows 11 guests.
- OVMF/UEFI firmware is supplied by the QEMU/libvirt module.
- Virt-manager provides the graphical manager.
- SPICE USB redirection is enabled.
- The desktop user belongs to the `libvirtd` group.

Before creating VMs, enable CPU virtualisation (SVM) in the motherboard UEFI.
IOMMU is only needed for device passthrough; it is not required for ordinary
KVM guests. GPU passthrough is deliberately not configured because the
integrated GPU is also driving the host desktop.

The default libvirt NAT network may need to be enabled once:

```sh
sudo virsh net-autostart default
sudo virsh net-start default
```

Useful checks:

```sh
ls -l /dev/kvm
virsh -c qemu:///system list --all
```

Because QEMU runs unprivileged, direct USB/PCI device assignment may require
additional per-device permissions. Do not solve that by running all QEMU
processes as root; add narrowly scoped access for the specific device instead.

## Security baseline

- The NixOS firewall is explicitly enabled, with no extra inbound ports opened.
- The existing iptables-based firewall backend is retained for compatibility
  with libvirt networking; nftables can be evaluated separately.
- Kernel image protection is enabled.
- Auditd records privileged command execution for both 64-bit and 32-bit
  processes.
- Kernel pointer and dmesg exposure are restricted; ptrace is limited to the
  normal parent/child model; unprivileged BPF is disabled.
- Filesystem protections for symlinks, hardlinks, FIFOs, and regular files
  are explicitly enabled.
- IPv4/IPv6 redirect acceptance and IPv4 source routing are disabled.
- Sudo requires a password and its authentication timestamp is limited to
  five minutes.
- Nix builds remain sandboxed; only root and wheel members may use the daemon,
  while only root is a trusted Nix user.
- Existing LUKS full-disk encryption and encrypted Btrfs layout are preserved.

This is a practical workstation baseline, not a claim of complete isolation.
AppArmor policy enforcement, Secure Boot, TPM-backed disk unlock, container
isolation, and device-specific USB restrictions need separate validation
before enabling them. Kernel-module locking is intentionally omitted because
this machine must load hardware, networking, Bluetooth, and KVM modules.

## Desktop

- Niri is enabled at the NixOS level so greetd can launch the session.
- Home Manager owns and validates the generated Niri KDL configuration.
- Noctalia is configured through its Home Manager module and validates its TOML.
- Noctalia uses the Catppuccin built-in palette and JetBrainsMono Nerd Font.
- Kitty and Zsh configuration remain owned by terminal-dotfiles to avoid
  competing Home Manager definitions.

Noctalia is pinned to its `cachix` branch. Its Nixpkgs input deliberately does
not follow the root Nixpkgs input: this preserves derivation compatibility
with the Noctalia Cachix binary cache. The nested Nixpkgs revision is pinned
in `flake.lock`.

## Validate and build

Run these commands from the repository root:

```sh
nix fmt
nix flake check --show-trace
nix build .#nixosConfigurations.starforge.config.system.build.toplevel --no-link
```

The Niri Home Manager module validates generated KDL, and the Noctalia module
validates generated settings during the build.

## Apply safely

First build the new system, then activate it as a test:

```sh
sudo nixos-rebuild build --flake .#starforge
sudo nixos-rebuild test --flake .#starforge
```

Check the Niri session, Noctalia shell, networking, Bluetooth, audio, portals,
screenshots, media keys, display controls, Vulkan/VA-API, sensors, and a test VM.
Only after those checks pass, make the generation the default:

```sh
sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#starforge
```

Keep the previous generation available in GRUB. To roll back from a running
system, use:

```sh
sudo nixos-rebuild switch --rollback
```

The generated hardware configuration contains the host's disk UUIDs and mount
layout. It is preserved under `hosts/starforge/` and must not be copied to a
different machine without regenerating it.

## Updating dependencies

Inputs are pinned by `flake.lock`. Review updates rather than tracking moving
branches at every rebuild:

```sh
nix flake update
git diff -- flake.lock
nix fmt
nix flake check --show-trace
```

Review Nixpkgs, Home Manager, Noctalia, and terminal-dotfiles changes before
applying them to the host. Do not change `system.stateVersion` merely to
follow a newer NixOS release; it remains `26.05` from the original install.

## Maintenance and recovery

- Garbage collection runs weekly and removes unreferenced store paths older
  than 14 days. Existing system generations are not automatically deleted.
- Store optimisation runs weekly.
- GitHub Actions checks formatting, evaluates the flake, and builds the
  Starforge system closure for pull requests and pushes to `main`.
- Keep a known-good generation and a copy of the hardware configuration
  before changing bootloader, LUKS, Btrfs, or kernel settings.

The old pre-dotfiles configuration is retained as a historical snapshot in
`archive/configuration.nix.before-dotfiles`; it is not imported by the flake.
